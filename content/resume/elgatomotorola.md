## ***Achievement: Developed integration for automated test between Motorola cellular base  station and test instrumet*** 
<p><br/></p>

### ***Role/Job: Agilent (now Keysight) Business Development Engineer***
### ***When: 2003***
<p><br/></p>
  
### Situation:
Agilent needed its new cellular base station tester to be integrated with the newly released Motorola LMF cellular base station. Having this would result in an endorsement by Motorola that would require operators adopting the Motorola base station to use (and purchase) Agilent's new device, the E7495A "EL GATO". A $10M order from Sprint PCS was on hold as the integration was a requirement.<p><br/></p>

### Actions:
In a few weeks I learned a new language (Java) and left for Motorola in Schaumburg, Illinois where together with Motorola engineers I wrote the integration software that enabled the communication between the two devices and implemented the measurements in the test instrument.<p><br/></p>

### Result:
The Sprint PCS $10M order booked and Motorola's endorsement for the new Agilent E7495A resulted in a stream of sales from operators adopting the Motorola LMF base station.
