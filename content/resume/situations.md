## SpaceX Windows Server Support Case
<br>

### The Situaiton:
A major change to our instrument software platform was reqired to win a large sale and enable future business at a customer where a competitor was well stablished. The change looked to add supoper for a verison MS Windows Server. Several departments had to agree to make changes to move forward. The majority conclude that sucg a big change wasn't worth the effort. <br><br>

### Actions I took:
One of the core objectives of my employer is to take market share from the competitor that was well established at the aforementioned customer. This competitor had the OS compatibility that I was trying to get my company to implement. I presented the case to management that not making the change would not only caused us to lose current and future deals but it was also going agains our leadership company-wide directive of taking market share from such competitor.

<br>


### The Result:
The chanhe was made. We won the deal and opened the door for future business

A customer purchased two noise figure analyzers from me under the condition that we would change the GUI to make the instrument look more like like the kegacy odel he was used to. Despite the factory having committed to make the changes per my request the products were delivered without them. The factory said that they had no resources to workon the changes. The customer threathen not onlty with returning the NF analyzers but also to avoid buying form Keysight whenever pssible and gave us a deadline to deliver.
