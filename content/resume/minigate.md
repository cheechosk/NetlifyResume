## ***Achievement: Developed integration for automated test between Motorola cellular base  station and test instrumet*** 
<p><br/></p>

### ***Role/Job: Agilent (now Keysight) Business Development Engineer***
### ***When: 2002***
<p><br/></p>
  
### Background:
Agilent needed its mobile phone test instruments (E6393B and E6392B) integrated into the "Motorola GATE" which was a test platform they deployed to authorized service  centers for phone diagnostics and repair. Integration with the GATE would enable control of the instrument for automated test. Without the integration, these Agilent's testers would miss on a large portion of the market at a time when Mototora was a dominant player   <p><br/></p>

### Actions:
In conjunction with Motorola engineers in Libertyville, Illinois, I wrote the integration software that was embedded into the Motorola GATE platform<p><br/></p>

### Result:
The Agilent E6393B and E6392B were deemed compatible with the Motorola GATE and cleared to be purchased by service centers for phone diagnostics and repair.
