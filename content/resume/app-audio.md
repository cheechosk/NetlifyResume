## ***Achievement: Created audio measurement application for large sales opportunity that became a standard option on Tektronix Real Time Spectrum Analyzer*** 
<p><br/></p>

### ***Role/Job: Tektronix Applications Engineer***
### ***When: 2006***
<p><br/></p>
  
### Situation:
A military contractor in the east coast needed a soulution to test SINCGARS radios after Agilent (previously HP, currentlly Keysight) discontinued the industry standard Audio Analyzers 8901/8902/8903. Rohde-Schwarz, Agilent and Tektrnix competed for the business.<p><br/></p>
  
### Actions:
I wrote an application that leveraged digital captures of either modulatd or unmodulated signals containing audio from a Tektronix Real Time Spectrun Analyzer to perform measurements such as: SINAD, THD, Hum and Noise, etc. It allowed applying a variety of standarf audio filters and presented a very nice GUI that mimicked the analizer GUI, so it ran as another screen of the instrument.  .<p><br/></p>

### Result:  
Tektronix, my employer, won the deal which resulted in a multi-million dollar sale back east. Later a similar opportunity was found and won in Texas. The functionality I developed eventually became an option (10) of the Real Time Spectrum Analyzer. I was awarded Teltronix Masters 2006 as a result of this effort.
