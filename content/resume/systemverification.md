### Confidence Check
 
 Somme test instruments have built in "Confidence Checks" that allow to verify for example that a calibraiton is correct. This looks to incover large variations from specs usually caused by bad cables, dirty or worn connectors, operator error, etc. An example of this is an ECal Confidence Check where parameters are measured on the ECal and compared to what it is stored in the unit's EPROM stored at the factory.<p><br/></p>

### System Verification

 This is a traceable accuracy validation of the calibrated measurement system:<br><br>
  - It verifies both, user calibrations and performance of the test instrument <br>
  - Validates that the instrument, test cables and calibration standards are able to work together as a "system"<br>
  - Does not guarantee the specified performance of individual components of the system, only the system as a whole
  - The System Verification process is guided by software which is built into the test instrument<br>
  - This method of validating the calibration requires "verification kits". These kits include precision airlines, mismatch airlines and precision fixed attenuators<br>
  - Verification kits include data and uncertainty of each standard on a disk or USB storage drive<br>
  - It does not require taking the instruent to a cervice centerverification kit<br>

### Performance Test

A series of tests measure the instrument performance against the published Technical Specifications. Passing all of these tests allows the instrument to be fully certified as a stand-alone instrument for all of its intended measurements.

This is ussually performed at calibraiton labs although some vendors offer solutions for running in-house performance tests and adjustments/
