## ***Achievement: Developed RADAR Generation Software for High Performance AWGs*** 
<p><br/></p>

### ***Role/Job: Tektronix Applications Engineer***
### ***When: 2007***
<p><br/></p>
  
### Situation:
Raytheon SAS in El Segundo requested a companion software for Tektronix' high performance AWGs to generate RADAR waveforms that could be loaded and generated in the AWG. My employer Teltronix, despite having the highest performance AWG at the time lacked software tools to produce meaninful signals to be loaded and generated. I took on the task to write such software application per Raytheon's engineers guidelines  <p><br/></p>
  
### Actions:
I wrote such application. A screenshot can be seen below. It started simple but more features were requested and added subsequently.<p><br/></p>

### Result:  
Multiple AWG sales to Raytheon SAS as well as in many other areas around the world where other Tektronix Apps Engineers used teh software with their clients.

About a year later, Tektronix released an official software product for waveform generation (RFXpress) for their AWGs. The RADAR section was incorporated directly from my code. Below is a screenshot of the tool that Tektronix eventually released. Similarities between the GUI's can be observed.
